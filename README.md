Problem Statement 

This project aims to build a Python application that analyzes and predicts student academic performance using supervised machine learning. The dataset includes demographic and educational factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation status to predict students' performance in subjects like math, reading, and writing.

The goal is to help educators and policymakers identify key factors affecting academic success, support at-risk students, and improve overall learning outcomes through

 data-driven decision-making.

📈 Insights Extracted from the Dataset
Here are some valuable insights the application can generate:

Performance Trends by Gender

Compare average scores across subjects for male vs. female students.

Impact of Parental Education

Analyze how parents’ education levels influence student performance.

Effect of Test Preparation

Evaluate whether completing a test preparation course improves scores.

Lunch and Learning

Determine if students with standard vs. free/reduced lunch perform differently.

Ethnicity-Based Trends

Explore average performance across different racial/ethnic groups.

Top Performers Identification

Identify students excelling in all subjects to study common factors.

✅ Benefits of the Application
🎓 Personalized Learning Insights
Enables schools to tailor support programs based on performance predictors.

📊 Data-Driven Policy Planning
Helps institutions make informed decisions regarding academic resources and curriculum development.

📉 Early Intervention
Detects students at risk of underperformance, enabling timely educational support.
